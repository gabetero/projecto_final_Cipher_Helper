# Group Proyect: CipherHelper

  This group program was designed to provide the means to encript/decript messages the User enters.  There are currently three kinds of ciphers available for the user.
  
## Features
  The user can currently choose between Encrypting and Decrypting the message they desire. Another feature we included is Hash Account Authentication, storing it in a text file.
  
## Ciphers
  The types of ciphers available are the following:
  - Shift Cipher
  - Rail Fence Cipher
  - Ceasar Cipher
  
## Shift Cipher
  A shift cipher is a substitution cipher, the principle of which is to shift the letters by one or more values in the alphabet.

## Ceasar Cipher
The Caesar cipher is a shift cipher, usually presented with a shift key of value 3.

## Vigenere Cipher
Vigenere cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that encrypt plaintext by shifting each character by a fixed number of positions determined by a key.
