# Cipher

  This group program was designed to provide the means to encript/decript messages the User enters.  There are currently three kinds of ciphers available for the user. .
  
## Options
  The user can currently choose between Encrypting and Decrypting the message he/she desires.

## Ciphers
  The types of ciphers available are the following:
  - Shift Cipher
  - Rail Fence Cipher
  - Ceasar Cipher
  
## Shift Cipher
  A shift cipher is a substitution cipher, the principle of which is to shift the letters by one or more values in the alphabet.

## Ceasar Cipher
The Caesar cipher is a shift cipher, usually presented with a shift key of value 3.

## Rail Fence Cipher
The rail fence cipher (also called a zigzag cipher) is a form of transposition cipher. It derives its name from the way in which it is encoded.
